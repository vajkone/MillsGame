# Mills Game
The Nine Men's Morris, also known as Mills game for 2 players, designed to be played in a [hotseat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotseat_(multiplayer_mode)) style.

## How to play
The game consists of 3 phases. 
1. In phase 1 each player must place 9-9 of their men on the empty slots of the board. This can be done by simply clicking on the empty slots.
2. After each player has placed all of their 9 pieces, phase 2 begins. In phase 2, you can move your men by first selecting 
(with a click) the piece you wish to move, then clicking on one of the adjacent slots. The slots you can move the selected piece to will be marked
with a green highlight circle. 

   At any point of the game if you manage to form a mill, you can (and have to) remove on of your opponent's pieces. This is also done by
   clicking on them. Legally removable pieces will be marked with a red highlight circle.
   
3. Phase 3 begins after one of the players is reduced to 3 pieces. That player can then jump anywhere on the board with their pieces.
4. The game ends if one of the players is either reduced to 2 pieces, gives up (by clicking on the button) or the players agree on a draw.
